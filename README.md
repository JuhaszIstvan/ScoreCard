# VBA-for-Excel

A collection of Vbafunctions that I have written for excel based reports. As a collection it isn't suffisant to support a complete process. It is not possible that there are smaller code sniplets lifted from the internet whose origins I have forgotten about. If so, please let me know so I could properly credit them. Thank you
